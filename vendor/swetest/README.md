# Swiss Ephemeris

The Swiss Ephemeris is the high precision ephemeris developed by [Astrodienst](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephinfo_e.htm), largely based upon the DExxx ephemerides from NASA's JPL. The original release in 1997 was based on the DE405/406 ephemeris. Since release 2.00 in February 2014, it is based on the DE431 ephemeris released by JPL in September 2013. The source can also be retrieved [here](http://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/).

They have two license options - one, the GPL, which only means that any code you write must also be GPL. And second, their license, which is paid.
